## Bring and Brag
* Kim Hargreaves - Slouchy Hat. Fisherman's Rib - ribs are usually knitting by k1p1 etc, but can also do k1, k1b etc and then in row 2 k1b, k1 - looks a bit like a brioche stitch. Its reversible, so great stich for scarves, shawls etc. Tutorial on this.
* Martin Storey - Windy scarf. Wool much nicer after washing.

## Knitters of the world
* Lene Alve from far north of Lapland, lighting and fire and looking ever so slightly mad ALL the time

## From the Archives
* Alice Starmore - Tudor Roses book - part fashion, part photography, part English history and ALL celebrating knitting
* True Fair Isle only ever has 2 colours in any one row
* Cardigans are much easier than jumpers because the steek up the middle of the front can be used to swap over the colours - so don't have to knit in lots of ends
* This particular pattern has 2 ways of doing the sleeves, either knit and then purl backwards and forwards OR do a steek - the steek DIDN'T prove bulky, so this way is fine
* Need good steeking wool - grippy wool - e.g. woollen spun Shetland, Alice Starmore Hebridean 2-ply or 3-ply
* Steek is typically 10 stitches wide - 1 and 10 are edge stitches - can use these to later pick up stitches and later on knit a band from - cut between 5 and 6 - then cut back so the steek edge is only 2 stitches wide - fold that back behind and sew it by hand flat, either using a finer yarn OR split the plys.

## Books
* Knitwear Design Workshop - Shirley Paden - what exactly is a set in sleeve and how to calculate it
* The Knowledgeable Knitter â€“ Margaret Radcliffe - recommended by [Eva from "The Charm of it"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLucMdhLGLSqCnsO5NlJIfssx_TBRAfshI)

## Technical
* Discussion of how Andrea altered her Alice Starmore jumper from drop sleeve to set in sleeve
* Demonstration of how set in sleeves work, numbers of stitches and how to calculate for your body
* Ensure if you are doing Fair Isle that the pattern on the body matches the pattern on the sleeve - pattern is the SAME where the set in sleeve starts (on the sleeve and the body)
* Discussion of how Andrea altered Andrew's Alice Starmore Bridit jumper from drop sleeves to modified drop sleeves
