## From the Archives

* Ashie by Lisa Richardson (Andrew wearing it, jumper in the titles) - done in pieces which is much harder with Fair Isle - usually you knit in the round so you only ever have to knit and not purl. Has a "saddle shoulder" which you often see in old Guernsey jumpers which helps support heavy fabrics.
