Holidaying in North Wales, hired a stone cottage, overlooking a graveyard, river and sheep. #location

Taught to knit by mother and grandmother about 6 or 7. First project was a rug knitted out of autumn leaves "triangles" - approx 100 leaves - cast on, 2 rows garter stitch, then decrease slowly: one side knit two together; other side slip one, knit one, pass slip stitch over - final 3 stitches, bind off.

School in Bright, Victoria - beautiful little alpine village. Lived in Aubrey, amazing shop "the haberdashery store".

Found a book in a wool shop in New York, knitted Elizabeth I (challenging at the time).
