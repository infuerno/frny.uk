## Under Construction
* Andrew - socks in Fine Art
* Andrea - Amaryllis, Marie Wallin - Andrea will do some tutorials on two handed purling - see Baa-ble hat to two handed knitting

## Knitters of the World
* Living in Germany - one nice green leafy design

## KAL
* Andrew's hiking jacket is mainly following a pattern in "Knits for Men"
* Wool - main - 50% hebridean, 50% alpaca - DK undied - gentle wash, still some lanolin
* Wool - accent - Rowan hemp tweed - 75% wook, 25% hemp
* Went down to 3mm needle to get a close knit fabric - suitable for windy weather
* Will use contrast colour in Rowan tweed hemp for the underneath of the hem (in 1x1 rib stitch), the front panels which disappear under the arms and the inside of the neck.
* For the hem - knit approx 8 stitches in contrast colour, then knit main colour and then pick up cast on row into knitted row when you get to it
