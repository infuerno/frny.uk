## Bring and Brag
* Andrew's hermione socks - couldn't find any sock blockers in Germany, so ironed them instead
* Andrea's Softyak Rowan Marie Wallin's Norbu - used kitchener stitch to join the reknitting sleeves back to the main garment
 - for socks it is ok to do it pretty tight on the toes
 - but for joining parts of garments, its better to do it a bit loose and then pull it a bit tighter to match the tension
 - description of how to secure the knitting above and below before cutting it in half
 - short video of the whole process - Andrea will do a more in depth tutorial on this

## KAL
* Andrew - first garment KAL - with sleeves, for adults - June to October 2016
* Andrea - big project Fair Isle KAL - no hats, gloves or cowls - could do a shawl / throw (see Alice Starmor - has a steek)
