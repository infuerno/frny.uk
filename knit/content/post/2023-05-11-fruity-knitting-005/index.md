## Under Construction

* Socks - Susan B Anderson's video on kitchener for socks
* Marie Wallin - Norbu - found a mistake in the pattern - Andrea is going to graft the bottom of the sleeve to the top of the sleeve and record the process for a tutorial
* Andrew's next socks project will be knitted from Rowan Fine Art - has mohair, from the Angora goat (unlike "Angora wool" which is from the Angora rabbit) - 60% of which is produced in South Africa.

## Knitters of the World
* Jo Kerrigan of West Cork, Ireland - the Celtic Memory Yarns blog - book Andrea mentions about the folklore of Ireland - https://obrien.ie/old-ways-old-secrets

## From the Archives
* Amelia, by Alex Pengelly from the Rowan Design Awards 2013
  * Rowan Felted Tweed
  * Andrea’s jumper - Watery 152 and Ancient 172, 
  * Madeleine’s jumper - Pine 158 and Avocado 161
* Knitted in the flat and seamed
* Andrea is happy to seam things but usually uses back stitch, she only uses matress stitch when needing something to line up perfectly
* A back stitch is a very solid, easy seam. Doesn't stick out much, also much faster and makes the whole garment extra sturdy.
* Mattress stitch takes a bit more time and is cumbersome to do
* Some comments about Elizabeth Zimmerman's designs / garment contruction

## Interview

* Garment construction with Canadian designer Elizabeth McCarten.
* Knitting Around by Elizabeth Zimmerman - autobiography
* Advice for beginners - don't use superwash wools, wet block as you go, knit something you can keep trying on e.g. top down - e.g. her pattern harriet's jacket, garments that don't require too many finishing techniques e.g. no picking up of stitches
* Fusion - new cardigan - https://chezlizzie.blogspot.com/2015/07/tutorial-perfect-picots.html
