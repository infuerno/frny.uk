## Bring and Brag
* Baa-bel Hat by Donna Smith - 2015 Shetland Wool Week pattern - Rowan Hemp Tweed
  - Andrea has knitted it and made a tutorial including two handed Fair Isle technique and weaving in the ends
  - several people had problems with sizing which Susan B Anderson has made some blog posts etc on
  - Andrea suspects it is because Scottish people tend to be "flickers" and therefore have a tighter gauge

## Under Construction
* Lovage - will check out Very Pink for videos on crocheting
