    <h2>Lesson 11</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 6th December 2008</h3>
    <p>First lesson since Bristol 10 years ago. Drove around near the Doctor's surgery in Borough Green, up to the roundabout, back through Borough Green, down Long Mill Lane, round the steep corner and reversed extremely badly into the close</p>
    <h2>Lesson 12</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 13th December 2008</h3>
    <p>Drove into Sevenoaks, lots of traffic, just about coped, back home.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 13</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 20th December 2008</h3>
    <p>Had a cold, parked up in the close for a while, then into Wrotham, did a three point turn and a reverse around the corner.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 14</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 10th January 2009</h3>
    <p>Drove to Sevenoaks, practised a couple of manoeuvres including a reverse park, seemed to do everything wrong after having felt like I was improving.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 15</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 18th January 2009</h3>
    <p>Borough Green practising more manoeuvres, did fairly well on the first two, then had a nightmare reverse park. Overall ok.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 16</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 26th January 2009</h3>
    <p>Outskirts of Sevenoaks, need to watch slowing down, break and then change gear, once I've slowed down. Change slowly to make sure I've selected the right gear. Have my heel on the floor of the car.</p>
    <h2>Lesson 17</h2>
    <h3>Saturday 2nd February 2009</h3>
    <p>Wrotham village round and round, slowing down practice, slowing down to biting point, slowing down and changing gear, turning off and junctions slowly and controlled.</p>
